## üß± Tech Stack

| Layer     | Stack | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Backend   | FastAPI, HTTPX, Pydantic, Redis (optional) | GraphQL client for AniList, AnimeThemes integration, puzzle caching |
| Frontend  | Next.js App Router, React 18, Tailwind CSS | Server-side data fetch with client-side persistence |
| Infra     | Docker Compose (API, Web, Redis) | Multi-stage builds, hot reload mounts |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Configure
```bash
git clone <repo-url> guesssenpai
cd guesssenpai
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in AniList OAuth credentials (`ANILIST_CLIENT_ID`, `ANILIST_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ANILIST_REDIRECT_URI`). Set `ANIMETHEMES_ENABLED=true` if you want the OP round active.

### 2. Run with Docker
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Services:
- API ‚Üí `http://localhost:8000`
- Web ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000`
- Redis ‚Üí `redis://localhost:6379`
Make sure `.env` sets `API_BASE_URL=http://api:8000` for server-side fetches inside Docker and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000` (or another browser-accessible host) for client-side calls.

### 3. Local Development

**Backend**
```bash
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```
Set `API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000` (server-side fetch) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000` (client) when running outside Docker.

  - Personalizes selection using AniList lists while avoiding recent repeats.
  - Hydrates game payloads, redacts descriptions, and optionally attaches AnimeThemes clips.
- **Session & OAuth**
  - AniList Authorization Code flow with state validation.
  - Signed session tokens stored server-side to protect AniList access tokens.
- **Frontend Experience**
  - Data fetched server-side, hydrated into responsive components with puzzle-specific progress context.
  - LocalStorage persistence prevents replaying solved puzzles and supports streak tracking.
  - Glassmorphism design with aurora gradients, subtle motion, and accessible focus treatments.
